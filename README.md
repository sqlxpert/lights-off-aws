# Lights Off!

For AWS users who forget to turn off the lights:

* **Cut AWS costs up to â…” in your sleep**, by tagging your EC2 instances and
  RDS databases with cron-style schedules. Lights Off stops or hibernates
  the instances, and stops the databases, while you are not using them, then
  starts them up before you need them again. It's perfect for development
  and test systems, which are idle at night and on weekends.

* You can also tag EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and RDS databases to schedule
  backups.

* Tag your CloudFormation stacks, and Lights Out will automatically delete
  and recreate the cost-bearing resources on schedule. All you need to do is
  add a parameter to your template.

## Comparison with AWS Services

AWS introduced AWS Backup, Data Lifecycle Manager, and Systems Manager after I
started this project in mid-2017. The three services have become more capable
over the years, but Lights Out still has advantages:

* Schedules and operations are immediately visible, in tags on the EC2 instance,
  EBS volume, RDS datase, or CloudFormation stack. You don't need to look up
  schedules and rules in other AWS services.

* Similarly, schedules and operations are easy to update. Just change a
  resource's tags!

* One tool can handle a wide variety of scheduled operations in EC2, RDS, and
  CloudFormation. Why should you have to use one service to schedule a backup,
  and a different service to schedule a reboot?

## Quick Start

1. Log in to the [AWS Web Console](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console).

2. Go to [EC2 instances](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Instances).
   Add the following tag to a sample instance:

   * `sched-backup`: `d=_&nbsp;H:M=11:30` , replacing 11:30 with the
     [current UTC time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc)
     plus 20 minutes

3. Go to the
   [S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).
   Create a bucket for AWS Lambda function source code.

   * `my-bucket-us-east-1` , replacing my-bucket with the name of your choice,
     and us-east-1 with the region in which your EC2 instance is located. Be
     sure to create the bucket in that region.

   _Security Tip:_ [Block public access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#console-block-public-access-options)
   to the bucket, and limit write access

4. Upload
   [lights_off_aws.py.zip](https://github.com/sqlxpert/lights-off-aws/raw/main/lights_off_aws.py.zip)
   to the S3 bucket

   _Security Tip:_ Compare the Etag reported by S3 with the file's checksum in
   [lights_off_aws.py.zip.md5.txt](lights_off_aws.py.zip.md5.txt)

5. Go to the
   [CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
   Click Create Stack. Click Choose File, immediately below Upload a template
   to Amazon S3, and navigate to your local copy of
   [cloudformation/lights_off_aws.yaml](https://github.com/sqlxpert/lights-off-aws/raw/main/cloudformation/lights_off_aws.yaml) .
   On the next page, set:

   * Stack name: `LightsOff`
   * Lambda code S3 bucket: Name of your bucket, not including the region. For
     example, if your bucket is my-bucket-us-east-1 , set this to `my-bucket` .

6. After 20 minutes, check
   [images](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Images:sort=desc:creationDate).

7. Before deregistering (deleting) the sample image that was created, note its
   ID, so that you delete the underlying
   [EBS volume snapshots](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Snapshots:sort=desc:startTime).
   Also remember to remove the `sched-backup` tag from your EC2 instance.

## Tag Keys (Operations)

| |Start or Stop|Back Up|Reboot then Back Up|Reboot|Reboot then Fail Over|Change Stack Parameter|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
||`sched-start`|`sched-backup`|`sched-reboot-backup`|`sched-reboot`|`sched-reboot-failover`|`sched-set-Enable-true`|
||`sched-stop`|||||`sched-set-Enable-false`|
|[EC2 instance](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Instances)|&check;|image (AMI)|image (AMI)|&check;|||
|[EBS volume](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#Volumes)||volume snapshot|||||
|[RDS database instance](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home#databases:)|&check;|database snapshot||&check;|&check;||
|[RDS database cluster](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home#databases:)|&check;|database cluster snapshot||&check;||
|[CloudFormation stack](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks)||||||&check;|

## Tag Values (Schedules)

* Time zone: always UTC
* Clock: always 24-hour
* Last digit of minute: always 0 (Scheduled operations happen during a
  10-minute cycle.)
* 2 digits: always required for hour, minute, and numeric day of
  month values (Use a leading zero if necessary.)
* Wildcard: single underscore `_` (RDS does not allow asterisks in tags.)
* Term separator: space (RDS does not allow commas in tags.)
* Ordered terms: days must be specified before times, and hours before minutes
  (For fast matching, any "once a month" and "once a week" terms should go at
  the beginning.)
* Completeness: a day, an hour and a minute must all be specified, or nothing
  will happen
* Terms:

  |Name|Minimum|Maximum|Wildcard|
  |--|--|--|--|
  |Day of month|`d=01`|`d=31`|`d=_`|
  |Weekday|`u=1` (Monday)|`u=7` (Sunday)||
  |Hour|`H=00`|`H=23`|`H=_`|
  |Minute (multiples of 10)|`M=00`|`M=50`||
  |Once a day|`H:M=00:00`|`H:M=23:50`||
  |Once a week|`uTH:M=1T00:00`|`uTH:M=7T23:50`||
  |Once a month|`dTH:M=01T00:00`|`dTH:M=31T23:50`||

* Multiple values: repeat the term (For example, `d=01 d=15` means _the
  1st and the 15th days of the month_.)
* Multiple operations on the same resource, at the same time: none will
  happen, and an error will be logged
* End-of-month: some months lack `d=29` through `d=31` ; consider
  `dTH:M=01T00:00`
* Standards: letters match
  [`strftime()`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man3/strftime.3.html)
  and weekday numbers match
  [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates)
  (`cron` uses different weekday numbers.)

* Examples:

  |Tag Value|Scenario|Meaning|
  |--|--|--|
  |`d=_ H:M=14:20`|Once a day|At 14:20 every day|
  |`uTH:M=1T14:20`|Once a week|At 14:20 every Monday|
  |`dTH:M=28T14:20`|Once a month|At 14:20 on the 28th day of every month|
  |`d=1 d=8 d=15 d=22 H=03 H=19 M=00`|cron-style|at 03:00 and 19:00 on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd days of every month|
  |`d=_ H=_ M=15 M=45 H:M=08:50`|Extra daily operation|At 10 and 40 minutes after the hour, every hour of every day, _and also_ every day at 08:50|
  |`d=_ H=11 M=00 uTH:M=2T03:30 uTH:M=5T07:20`|2 extra weekly operation|At 11:00 every day, _and also_ every Tuesday at 03:30 and every Friday at 07:20|
  |`u=3 H=22 M=15 dTH:M=00T05:20`|Extra monthly operation|At 22:10 every Wednesday, _and also_ at 05:20 on the first day of every month|

  Operations do not happen at exact times. An operation scheduled at 14:20
  happens sometime after 14:20 but before 14:30, for example.

## Child Resources

Backup operations create a "child" resource (image or snapshot) from a
"parent" AWS resource (instance, volume, database, or database cluster).

### Naming

* The name of the child consists of several parts, separated by hyphens (`-`):

  |#|Part|Example|Purpose|
  |--|--|--|--|
  |1|Prefix|`zsched`|Identifies and groups resources created by Lights Off. `z` is intended to sort after most manually-created images and snapshots.|
  |2|Parent name or identifier|`webserver`|Conveniently identifies the parent. Derived from the `Name` tag, the logical name, or the physical identifier. Multiple children of the same parent will sort together, by creation date and time.|
  |3|Date and time|`20171231T1400Z`|Groups children created at the same time. The minute is always a multiple of 10. The time zone is always UTC (Z).|
  |4|Random suffix|`g3a8a`|Guarantees unique names. 5 characters are chosen from a small set of unambiguous letters and numbers.|

* The parent name or identifiere may contain additional, internal hyphens.
* Characters forbidden by AWS are replaced with X.
* For some resource types, the description is also set to the name, in case the
  Console shows only one or the other.

### Special Tags

* Special tags are added to the child:

  |Tag|Description|
  |--|--|
  |`Name`|The friendly name of the child. In the EC2 Console, the `Name` column is determined from `Name` tag values.|
  |`sched-parent-name`|The `Name` tag value from the parent. May be blank.|
  |`sched-parent-id`|The identifier of the parent instance, volume, database or database cluster.|
  |`sched-op`|The operation tag key (for example, `sched-backup`) that prompted creation of the child. Distinguishes special cases, such as whether an EC2 instance was rebooted before an image was created (`sched-reboot-backup`).|
  |`sched-cycle-start`|The date and time when the child was created. The minute is always a multiple of 10. The time zone is always UTC (Z).|

* Although AWS stores most of this information as resource properties/metadata,
  the field names/keys vary from service to service, as do the search
  capabilities -- and some values, such as exact creation time, are too precise
  to allow for grouping. Searching by tag works in both EC2 and RDS.

* User-created tags whose keys don't begin with `sched-` are copied from parent
  to child. You can change the CopyTags parameter in CloudFormation to prevent
  this, for example, if your organization has different tagging rules for EC2
  instances and images.

## Output

* After logging in to the [AWS Web Console](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/console),
  check the
  [LightsOff CloudWatch log groups](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:prefix=/aws/lambda/LightsOff-).
* Log messages (except for uncaught exceptions) are JSON objects, with a Type
  key to summarize the message and indicate which other keys will be present.
* You can change the LogLevel parameter in CloudFormation.

## On/Off Switch

* You can change the Enable parameter in CloudFormation.
* This switch is per-region and per-AWS-account.
* While Enable is false, scheduled operations do not happen; they are skipped
  permanently.

## Security Model

* Allow only a few trusted users to tag AWS resources. You can restrict the
  right to add, change and delete `sched-` tags by including the
  [`aws:TagKeys` condition key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html#access_tags_control-tag-keys)
  in IAM policies, permission boundaries, and service control policies.

* Sometimes, such restrictive policies have the effect of requiring users to
  change or delete only one tag at a time.

* Do not allow a role that can create backups to delete backups.

* Choose from these sample IAM policies:

  * LightsOffTag
  * LightsOffNoTag

* Although the LightsOffTag policy is sufficient for tagging via the AWS API,
  users who are not AWS administrators will need additional privileges to use
  the Console. Examples:

  * [AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess)
  * [AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess)
  * [AWSCloudFormationReadOnlyAccess](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCloudFormationReadOnlyAccess)

* You may have to
  [decode authorization errors](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/decode-authorization-message.html).
  The LightsOffTag sample policy grants the necessary privilege.

* Note these AWS security gaps:

  * Authority to create an EC2 instance image includes authority to reboot
    (Explicitly denying the reboot privilege does not help.) A harmless
    privilege, taking a backup, is married with a risky one, rebooting.

  * In RDS, permission to add a specific tag also includes permission to add
    _any other_ tags in the same API call!

## Advanced Installation

Before starting a multi-region and/or multi-account installation, delete the
ordinary LightsOff CloudFormation stack in all regions, in all AWS accounts.

### Multi-Region Configuration

(Under review)

If you intend to install LightsOff in multiple regions,

1. Create S3 buckets in all [regions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) where you intend to install LightsOff. The bucket names must all share the same prefix, which will be followed by a region suffix (e.g. `-us-east-1`). The region in which each bucket is created _must_ match the suffix at the end of the bucket's name.

2. Upload [lights_off_aws_perform.py.zip](https://github.com/sqlxpert/lights-off-aws/raw/main/lights_off_aws_perform.py.zip) to each bucket. The need for copies in multiple regions is an AWS Lambda limitation.

3. Keep the following rules in mind when setting parameters, later:

   |Section|Parameter|Value|
   |--|--|--|
   |Basics|Lambda code S3 bucket|_Use the shared prefix; for example, if you created_ my-bucket-us-east-1 _and_ my-bucket-us-west-2 _, use_ `my-bucket`|

### Multi-Account Configuration

(Under review)
If you intend to install LightsOff in multiple AWS accounts,

1. In every target AWS account, create the [pre-requisite stack](https://github.com/sqlxpert/lights-off-aws/raw/main/cloudformation/lights_off_aws-prereq.yaml). Set:

   |Item|Value|
   |--|--|
   |Stack name|`LightsOffPrereq`|
   |AWSCloudFormationStackSet*Exec*utionRoleStatus|_Choose carefully!_|
   |AdministratorAccountId|AWS account number of main (or only) account; leave blank if AWSCloudFormationStackSet*Exec*utionRole existed before this stack was created|
   |LambdaCodeS3Bucket|Name of AWS Lambda function source code bucket (shared prefix, in a multi-region scenario)|

2. For the AWS Lambda function source code S3 bucket in *each region*, create a
bucket policy allowing access by *every target AWS account*'s
AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole (StackSet installation) or
LightsOffCloudFormation role (manual installation with ordinary CloudFormation).
The full name of the LightsOffCloudFormation role will vary; for every target
AWS account, look up the random suffix in [IAM roles](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles),
or by selecting the LightsOffInstall stack in
[CloudFormation stacks](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks)
and drilling down to Resources. S3 bucket policy template:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "AWS": [
             "arn:aws:iam::TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_1:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",
             "arn:aws:iam::TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_1:role/LightsOffInstall-LightsOffCloudFormation-RANDOM_SUFFIX_1",

             "arn:aws:iam::TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_2:role/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",
             "arn:aws:iam::TARGET_AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_2:role/LightsOffInstall-LightsOffCloudFormation-RANDOM_SUFFIX_2"
           ]
         },
         "Action": [
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:GetObjectVersion"
         ],
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

### CloudFormation Stack*Set* Installation

(Under review)

1. Follow the [multi-region steps](#multi-region-configuration), even for a multi-account, single-region scenario.

2. Follow the [multi-account steps](#multi-account-configuration). In a single-account, multi-region scenario, no S3 bucket policy is needed.

3. If [StackSets](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html) has never been used, create [AWSCloudFormationStackSet*Admin*istrationRole](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stackset-sample-templates-us-east-1/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.yml). Do this one time, in your main (multi-account scenario) or only (single-account scenario) AWS account. There is no need to create AWSCloudFormationStackSet*Exec*utionRole using Amazon's template; the LightsOff*Install* stack provides it, when necessary.

4. In the AWS account with the AWSCloudFormationStackSet*Admin*istrationRole, go to the [StackSets Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/stacksets/home#/stacksets).

5. Click Create StackSet, then select Upload a template to Amazon S3, then click Browse and select your local copy of [cloudformation/lights_off_aws.yaml](https://github.com/sqlxpert/lights-off-aws/raw/main/cloudformation/lights_off_aws.yaml) . On the next page, set:

   |Section|Item|Value|
   |--|--|--|
   ||StackSet name|`LightsOff`|
   |Basics|Lambda code S3 bucket|_Use the shared prefix; for example, if you created_ my-bucket-us-east-1 _, use use_ `my-bucket`|

6. On the next page, specify the target AWS accounts, typically by entering account numbers below Deploy stacks in accounts. Then, move the target region(s) from Available regions to Deployment order. It is a good idea to put the main region first.

## Software Updates

New versions of AWS Lambda function source code and CloudFormation templates
will be released from time to time. Because CloudFormation does not detect
changes in AWS Lambda function source code stored in S3, the easiset way to
update the AWS Lambda functions is to create a new stack such as
`LightsOff02`, set the Enable parameter to `false` initially, delete the old
stack, and then enable the new one.

## Advice

* Test your backups! Can they be restored successfully?

* Rebooting EC2 instances is necessary for coherent file system backups, but
  rebooting takes time and carries risks. Make some backups
  `sched-reboot-backup` but make most of them `sched-backup` (no reboot).

* Be aware: of charges for running the AWS Lambda functions, queueing
  scheduled operations in SQS, logging to CloudWatch Logs, and storing images
  and snapshots; of the whole-hour cost when you stop an RDS database or an
  EC2 Windows or commercial Linux instance (but [other EC2 instances have a
  1-minute minimum](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-per-second-billing-for-ec2-instances-and-ebs-volumes/));
  of ongoing storage charges for stopped EC2 instances and RDS databases; and
  of costs that resume when AWS automatically starts an RDS instance that has
  been stopped for 7 days. There might be other AWS costs as well!

* Test the AWS Lambda functions and IAM policies in your own AWS environment.
